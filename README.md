# Facebook Pixel Plugin for NodeBB

Track your users' actions with Facebook Pixel.

## How The Facebook Pixel Works

When someone visits your website and takes an action (for example, buying something), the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action. This way, you'll know when a customer took an action after seeing your Facebook ad. You'll also be able to reach this customer again by using a Custom Audience. When more and more conversions happen on your website, Facebook gets better at delivering your ads to people who are more likely to take certain actions. This is called conversion optimisation.

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-facebook-pixel
